  <h1> Modern yoying </h1>
    <p> Yoyos in 2021 are nothing like what you might remeber them. Yoyos no longer have a body with two semi-spheres in either side and does not even function in the same manner.
      The yoyos you have used when you were younger used a stem and axle system to wrap string around it which allowed for it to go down and if tugged on, then up.
      Modern yoyos on the other hand use bearings instead. While there are some that will go back up if tuggged on, most modern yoyos do not come back up and stay spinning at the end of the string. 
      This allows users to create and perform many types of tricks that woudlv'e been otherwise impossible. On top of this, the shape of yoyos have also changed to a flared out shape which lets users catch strings on the yoyo.
