    <h2> Modern yoying </h2>
    <p> Yoyos in 2021 are nothing like what you might remeber them. Yoyos no longer have a body with two semi-spheres in either side and does not even function in the same manner.
      The yoyos you have used when you were younger used a stem and axle system to wrap string around it which allowed for it to go down and if tugged on, then up.
      Modern yoyos on the other hand use bearings instead. While there are some that will go back up if tuggged on, most modern yoyos do not come back up and stay spinning at the end of the string. 
      This allows users to create and perform many types of tricks that woudlv'e been otherwise impossible. On top of this, the shape of yoyos have also changed to a flared out shape which lets users catch strings on the yoyo. </p>
     <h2> Different types of yoyos </h2>
    <p> You may remeber yoyos being made out of cheap wood  but modern yoyos are made with plastic, aluminum, steel, titanium or a mix of these materials. Plastic yoyos are the cheapest, usually under 20$ and are also the lightest of the bunch
    Aluminum yoyos are also light and is the next step up. They are much more sturdier and are also more expensive. This is the standard for mordern yoyos and costs around $45. Next step up is bimetal yoyos. 
    These are made with an aluminum body but have steel rims on the edges. Since the weight is distributed to the edge, it provides a much more powerful spin and balance. These yoyos are pretty difficult to make thus being very expensive at $120+.
    Next are hybrid yoyos. There are not many of these availabel and only few models of these exist. These are similar to bimetal yoyos but the body is made of very light weight polycarbonate plastic and have steel rims.
    This allows for a very heavy outer weight and very powerful spin while the actual yoyo does not weigh that much. These are priced at anwhere from $60-80. Lastly we have titanium yoyos. 
    These are very versatile yoyos but does not really differ from aluminum yoyos funciton wise besides the weight. It is more of a special thing to have and isn't frequently used in competitions.
    These are carved from solid chunks of titanium and are very expensive and goes for $300-500</p>
